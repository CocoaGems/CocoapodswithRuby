# CocoapodswithRuby

To all README.md readers this is a shared space for Emma and I to collaborate and share our work together.
Hopefully this will also be a blue print of our journey to learning Ruby and of our collaboration with the Amazing RailsGirlSummerofCode, CocoaPods and Github this Summer 2015.
